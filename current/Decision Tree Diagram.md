To illustrate the decision-making process for browser checks and actions taken in the `LazyImage` component, a decision tree can help visualize the logic flow. Here’s a structured decision tree that outlines the steps and conditions for handling various browser features and loading states.

### Decision Tree for Browser Checks and Actions

#### 1. **Initial Setup**

- **Start**
  - Check WebP Support
  - Check IntersectionObserver Support
  - Check Lazy Loading Support

#### 2. **WebP Support Check**

- **WebP Supported?**
  - **Yes**
    - Proceed to IntersectionObserver Support Check
  - **No**
    - **Load WebP Polyfill**
    - **WebP Polyfill Loaded Successfully?**
      - **Yes**
        - Proceed to IntersectionObserver Support Check
      - **No**
        - Log Error and Proceed to IntersectionObserver Support Check

#### 3. **IntersectionObserver Support Check**

- **IntersectionObserver Supported?**
  - **Yes**
    - **Proceed to Lazy Loading Support Check**
  - **No**
    - **Load IntersectionObserver Polyfill**
    - **IntersectionObserver Polyfill Loaded Successfully?**
      - **Yes**
        - Proceed to Lazy Loading Support Check
      - **No**
        - Log Error
        - Assume IntersectionObserver is Not Supported

#### 4. **Lazy Loading Support Check**

- **Lazy Loading Supported?**
  - **Yes**
    - **Use Native Lazy Loading**
    - Set `inView` to `true`
    - Set `loadState` to `loading`
  - **No**
    - Use IntersectionObserver or Immediate Loading Based on Support

#### 5. **Image or Iframe Handling**

- **Is It an Iframe?**
  - **Yes**
    - **Handle Iframe Loading and Error States**
    - Render Placeholder and Error Handling for Iframe
  - **No**
    - **Handle Image Loading and Error States**
    - Render Placeholder and Error Handling for Image

#### 6. **Loading and Error States**

- **In View?**
  - **Yes**
    - **Start Loading**
    - **Image/Iframe Load Successful?**
      - **Yes**
        - Set `loadState` to `loaded`
      - **No**
        - Retry Loading (if attempts left)
        - **Retry Successful?**
          - **Yes**
            - Set `loadState` to `loaded`
          - **No**
            - Set `loadState` to `error`
            - Log Error
- **Not In View**
  - **Show Placeholder**
  - **Wait for IntersectionObserver to Trigger**
  - **Set `inView` to `true` and Start Loading When Triggered**

### Decision Tree Diagram

Here’s a textual representation of the decision tree:

```
Start
  |
  |-- Check WebP Support
  |     |-- WebP Supported?
  |     |      |-- Yes --> Check IntersectionObserver Support
  |     |      |-- No  --> Load WebP Polyfill
  |     |                      |-- WebP Polyfill Loaded Successfully?
  |     |                      |      |-- Yes --> Check IntersectionObserver Support
  |     |                      |      |-- No  --> Log Error --> Check IntersectionObserver Support
  |     
  |-- Check IntersectionObserver Support
  |     |-- IntersectionObserver Supported?
  |     |      |-- Yes --> Check Lazy Loading Support
  |     |      |-- No  --> Load IntersectionObserver Polyfill
  |     |                      |-- IntersectionObserver Polyfill Loaded Successfully?
  |     |                      |      |-- Yes --> Check Lazy Loading Support
  |     |                      |      |-- No  --> Log Error --> Assume Not Supported
  |     
  |-- Check Lazy Loading Support
  |     |-- Lazy Loading Supported?
  |     |      |-- Yes --> Use Native Lazy Loading
  |     |      |-- No  --> Use IntersectionObserver or Immediate Loading
  |     
  |-- Is It an Iframe?
  |     |-- Yes --> Handle Iframe Loading and Error States
  |     |-- No  --> Handle Image Loading and Error States
  |
  |-- In View?
        |-- Yes --> Start Loading
        |         |-- Load Successful?
        |         |      |-- Yes --> Set LoadState to Loaded
        |         |      |-- No  --> Retry Loading (if attempts left)
        |         |                  |-- Retry Successful?
        |         |                  |      |-- Yes --> Set LoadState to Loaded
        |         |                  |      |-- No  --> Set LoadState to Error
        |         |                  |                  |-- Log Error
        |
        |-- Not In View --> Show Placeholder --> Wait for IntersectionObserver to Trigger
                           |-- Set InView to True and Start Loading When Triggered
```

### Key Points

- **WebP and IntersectionObserver Polyfills**: Handle browser compatibility for modern features.
- **Lazy Loading**: Utilize native support or fallback to IntersectionObserver.
- **Error Handling**: Implement retries and error states with appropriate messaging.

This decision tree ensures that your `LazyImage` component adapts to various browser capabilities and provides a robust user experience with appropriate fallback mechanisms and error handling.
